# Yaddasht-Flutter
A simple todo app that is written in Flutter and uses Firebase as back end

This is a project that I did to understand how Flutter works and how to use Firebase Firestore as a database for my future apps.
This app is not completed but has limited functionality that works.

### Features
- User login and registration with Firebase authentication
- Login and Registration form validation
- Read/Write documents (notes) from/to Firetore
- Search functionality
